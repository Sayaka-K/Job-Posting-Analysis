# Job-Posting-Analysis

The aim of this project is to provide a decision making tool for job seekers in the analytics fields.
Specifically, the project consists of two parts: **Visualizations** and **Predictive modeling**.  

The **Visualizations** offer key insights from the job postings data relating to the followings: 
  
  * Locations
* Sectors & Industries 
* Qualification & Skills
* Salary 

The **predictive tool** allows the users to get an estimate on Annual salary based on features variables (e.g., Analytics-specific skills such as SQL and Visualization, and Company information such as Industry and number of employees)
